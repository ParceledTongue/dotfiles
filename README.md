For my own personal use. But feel free to take a look if you're curious!

Thanks to Michael Smalley for his [how-to][1] on dotfile repos :)

Installation
------------

``` console
$ git clone https://github.com/ParceledTongue/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./makesymlinks.sh
```

Several other dependencies are necessary to get everything working properly, particularly [oh-my-zsh][2].
